    <ul>
      <li>I was born in the friendliest state of Texas or as we natives call it Tejas and raised in Dallas.</li>
      <li>I graduated from the Science and Engineering High School where I was first formally taught the programming language Java. </li>
      <li>Upon graduation I went on to finish my Associates in Engineering at Richland College. 
      </li>
      <li>My journey later took me from studying Software Engineering and Cognitive Science at The University of Texas at Dallas.</li>
      <li> Next to studying Software Engineering virtually at Arizona State University while flying around the world as a flight attendant and based in Seattle, Washington.

      <li>As I came to an end of my Bachelor's program I realized I had a cross of passion and interest in real estate.</li>
      <li>I understood even a software engineer had to pay a realtor and wanted to learn more.</li>
      <li>I switched my major to Liberal studies to merge my interests in Engineering with my interests in human development and sustainability.</li>
      <li>I went on to move back to Texas and get my Real Estate license in 2017.</li>
      <li>I could write code and engineer complex problems, which was great, until I entered the Real Estate industry and realized talking with people, building relationships, and maintaining those relationships is most important.</li> 
    </ul>

      <li>
      I enrolled to study in the Master of Liberal Studies program at the Annette Caldwell Simmons School of Education and Human Development at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.</li>
      <li>Here I participated in courses on The Human Experience, Organizational Strategy, and Coaching within organizations. I had the opportunity to take a course on Dispute Resolution and Human Rights where we studied abroad in Italy.</li>
      <li>The course that changed my life I completed in 2020 and it was led by Dr. Jennifer Parvin on Emotional Intelligence.</li>

      <li>While studying for my Masters, I worked as a Realtor, Substitute Teacher, and even took a contract job working for 7Now a 7Eleven company as a Operations and Fulfillment Analyst.</li>
      <li>I graduated in 2020 in the middle of the Pandemic and moved back to Seattle.</li>
      <li>I obtained my Washington Real Estate License and began working for Redfin as an Associate Agent for a year then was promoted to Licensed Listing Coordinator.</li>
      <li>After a round of Layoffs I found myself taking a break from real estate and looking to connect back with the Tech industry. First I obtained a part-time job as a Kids Coding Instructor at Coding With Kids.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Then, I obtained a contract position with Amazon as a Recruiting coordinator and was let go in their first round of layoffs. </li>
      <li>Grateful, this led me to Code Fellows where I now work as an Admissions Coordinator.</li>
      <li>My big goals for 2023 include completing the Code Fellows full-stack developer courses, purchasing my first property, and visit a new continent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am excited for what the future holds.</p>
